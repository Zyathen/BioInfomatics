# Tools for DNA Replication

## Project Description

### Part 1

Method to find a short string within a longer string, using algorithms to minimize the run time and optimize the search.

#### Structure of the Files

Input File
The first line contains the query.
The second line contains the text that the query is searched against.

Output File
Contains a list of indexes where the query match starts, where indexing starts at 0.

### Part 2

The method finds the location within the genome that minmizes the skew.
